This project is created by Jason Lee (https://github.com/awesomelemonade) and is written in Rust for the Cloudflare 2020 Internship Application: Systems

Please be aware that I started learning Rust about a week ago when this was initially assigned. I always wanted to learn Rust and I found this to be the perfect chance to learn it. My primary resource is this book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html.


Notes:
IPv6 was not tested, but should work. My internet/router is currently only supports IPv4.
